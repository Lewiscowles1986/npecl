# Exploration of NPecl

This is just a tyre kick on the NPecl defined at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_N0E9xo3jn9aKrIZHIbTYaY5lXw71BpSO6-it4cRpDo/

I was trying to think about parsing this format and what such a tool would require.

I likely got a bit lost in PHP project setup and kicking the tyres of PEST

## Usage

```
composer install
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
vendor/bin/pest --coverage tests
```
